## Lyrics

```
get you man out
get you man out it's time to fill the void

say what you want still i'm gonna follow through to my own
say what you say to make me spinning, it's a call to place the crown
there's always time to make amends, trick's not in placing blame

you should fix me i've been broken for quite a while
feeling done gets me down every single fucking day
make sure to put on a(nother) smiling face
brave face to the tragedy of the traces
that are gone with every word he says

relentless pressure 
i'm mean fuck this shit
fuck this state 

get you man out
get you man out it's time to fill the void

```
